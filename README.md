### Description
## The problem Split Estate solves
Our project aims to solve several problems by creating a blockchain-based platform for buying and selling fractions of apartment complexes. The first problem we tackle is the complexity and inconvenience of traditional methods for dividing and transferring ownership of properties. Our platform simplifies the process, allowing anyone to easily buy and sell shares in apartment complexes with just a few clicks.

In addition to streamlining the buying and selling process, our platform also addresses issues of security and transparency. By using a blockchain, we are able to record all transactions on a secure, decentralized ledger that is nearly immune to manipulation. This not only protects the interests of investors, but also helps to build trust in the platform.

Smart contracts also help to automate certain processes, such as rent collection and distribution of profits, which saves time and effort and reduces the risk of errors or misunderstandings.

Overall, our platform has the potential to revolutionize the way that people invest in real estate. By making it easy for anyone to become a landlord, we are opening up new opportunities for individuals to build wealth and achieve financial independence. And with the increased liquidity provided by our marketplace, investors will have more flexibility to buy and sell shares as their needs and circumstances change.
